# PyGrind 🔥

Welcome to my Python journey — where every line of code is one rep toward my future.

## 🎯 Vision
- 💻 Become a skilled AI Engineer  
- 📈 Earn 75+ LPA with real skill  
- 🏎️ Own a dark blue Porsche  
- 🧠 Build from zero, with discipline and focus  

## 📅 Day 1: The Beginning
- ✅ Installed Python & IDE (Pydroid3 or PC)
- ✅ Learned:
  - `print()` function
  - `input()` and basic user interaction
  - variables and simple math (`int + int`)
- ✅ Made my first mini program (input 2 numbers and print their sum)

## 🚀 The Mission

No shortcuts.  
No distractions.  
Just a silent grind.  
I’m not here to flex — I’m here to build.
